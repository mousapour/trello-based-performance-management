# trello-based-performance-management

I implemented this project in 2018 at Cafe Bazaar Internship program. I have recently added a number of my public projects to my github. 

This program works on Trello. It reads the available cards and analyzes the task estimated time, the consumed time and the categories. The program demonstrates useful statistical data with regard to this information such as the categories that a team member might have difficulties with.
